In 2022 I:
- Read 134 books.
- Read 40,0005 pages. 
- Escaped from a school-imposed reading drought. 
In 2023 I:
- Want to read at least 52 books.
- Want to read at least 20,000 pages.
- Want to do a better job tackling some of the books I keep meaning to read and not getting to.
- Finish all the books I’ve started and left somewhere around the house.
As I discussed in my post on [what I read in 2022]({% post_url 2022-12-22-what-i-read-2022 %}), last year was a great reading year for me. Given the amount I read last year, I know that 52 books and 20,000 pages might seem conservative. I get that. It’s important to me, though, that reading not feel like something I’m forcing myself to do. If I make my reading goal, great! If not, that’s just fine, too. The most important thing is to enjoy the books and the time I spend with them. It’s probably also important to finish some of the books I have scattered around the house? That, too! Anyway, I’m looking forward to this year’s reading. I finished Naomi Novik’s *The Golden Enclaves* yesterday (more on that soon) and started Ann Leckie’s *The Raven Tower* this morning. Next up? I’m not sure! I’ll figure it out.

If you’d like to follow along with my reading this year, I’m on [The Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/wishfulwriting). You can also [say hi anytime]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.md %}). I’d love to hear from you!
