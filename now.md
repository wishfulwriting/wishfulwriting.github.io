# What I'm up to now
I'm trying to learn new things, including HTML/CSS and Jekyll. I'm also trying to cook more, write more, and appreciate the positive things in life in spite of ***waves hands vaguely at the world***. I'll try to update this page as I make more specific plans around all of this. 

Inspiration: I got the idea of a /now page from [jamesg.blog](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/). If you want to see more /now pages, visit [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).
