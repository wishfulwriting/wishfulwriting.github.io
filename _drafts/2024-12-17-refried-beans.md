# Instant Pot Refried Beans
## Ingredients
- 1 lb. dry pinto beans
- 1 onion, quartered
- 2 tbsp. avocado oil[^1]
- 2 tbsp. lime juice
- 1 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 1/2 tsp. cumin
- 1 tsp. oregano
- 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp. onion powder
- 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper

### Footnotes
[^1]: Olive oil or canola oil will also work, but for whatever reason I've found I get the best texture with avacado oil.
